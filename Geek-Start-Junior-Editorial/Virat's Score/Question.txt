Virat and Rohit are playing on the field. It's a T20 match so we must display number of runs scored in given number of balls.

You will be given two array of which one contains the data of who was on strike for that ball and the other contains the runs scored for that ball respectively.

Your task is to calculate the runs scored by virat in given balls and the strike rate.

Input Format

1st line consists an integer: The number of balls that is to be considered for the score 2nd line consists who held the strike for that correspoding ball: n space seperated characters.('V' corresponds to Virat and 'R' corresponds Rohit) 3rd line consists of Run Scored for each ball: n space seperated integer values.

Constraints

0 < n <=120 0 <= score[i] <=6

Output Format

print the virat's score and strike rate

Sample Input 0

6
V V V R V R
4 6 1 1 1 1
Sample Output 0

12 300.00
Explanation 0

The first line has the integer 6 which represents the number of balls being considered.
So in the second line we have 6 characters representing the strike held for each ball.
As virat has played 4 balls and scored 4 6 1 1 repectively the total score would be 12 and the strike rate is 300.00

CALCULATING STRIKE RATE:

strike_rate = ((Total Score)/(Number of Balls played))*100
hence the strike of virat = ((12)/(4))*100 = 300.00

Sample Output 1

0 0.00
